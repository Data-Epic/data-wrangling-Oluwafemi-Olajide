# Customer Segmentation Analysis  

This project focuses on **data wrangling and customer segmentation analysis** using Python (Pandas & NumPy). The analysis includes:  

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting dates.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating a "Loyalty Score" based on total purchases and membership duration.  
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarizing customer purchase behavior across different countries.  
- **Data Aggregation**: Identifying high-loyalty customers and country-wise purchase trends.  

## Project Structure  
The following files are stored inside the **`task-1/`** folder:  
- **`DataWrangling.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.  
- **`processed_data_<date>.csv`** – Cleaned and structured dataset for further analysis.
